One thing very distinct about our network is how sparse and poorly connected it is as a whole. In some other papers I've read, the SEKE paper and Newman's paper (who is the best connected scientist?), the largest connected component of the networks they analyze constitute some 50% and above of the total volume of the graph. Our largest connected component is 34 authors, while there are 259 authors in total, which means the largest connected component covers a mere 13% of the network. Do you think this is because our data set is much smaller and pulled only from one year?

Clustering coefficient:

Fraction of connected triples of vertices which also form triangles of interaction.

C = 3* number of triangles on the graph / number of vertices connected in a triple
*What is a good way to calculate the clustering coefficient? 

There is a three in the numerator because each complete triangle of three vertices contributes three connected triples. C = 1 on a completely connected graph. In social networks, clustering coefficient is predicted to take a non-zero value because of the large probability that two people will be acquainted if they have another acquaintance in common. 

Geodesic: shortest path of vertices and edges that links two given vertices. It can be calculated
with a modified BFS algorithm, given by Cormen et al, 2001 -- Mentioned in the Newman paper of "Who is the best connected scientist?" 

Betweeness of an author: 

Total number of shortest paths between pairs of authors that pass through i.
