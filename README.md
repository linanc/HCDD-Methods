Human Centered Design for Development - Social Network Analysis 

Previously, we assembled a data set of scholarly papers on solving global development challenges through human-centered design projects. We want to leverage this data set to understand what this community of researchers looks like. The goal is to better understand the landscape of the current research community in design for development.

Uses Python 3.4.2, pickle, networkX, json, matplotlib packages.
